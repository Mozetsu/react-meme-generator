# Meme Generator consuming external API
Project built from scratch to test my knowledge in React.

## Objective
Build a web application where users can generate memes. It should be built without entirely fro scratch. Users should be greeted with a form where they can input text for both the top section of the meme as well as the bottom one. Users can type the meme text in inputs of the form and it should be placed on top of the image every time the value of any input changes. Images should be retrieved from an external API and rendered to the screen. A button to get a random new image should be provided.
